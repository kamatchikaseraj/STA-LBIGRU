# STA-LBIGRU
An innovative approach to predict insider threats in user behavior analysis. This method incorporates Contextual Adaptive Imputation to address incomplete data, tackles class imbalance with the Condensed Nearest Neighbors-Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, employs Ensemble Feature Extraction for a comprehensive view of user behavior, and introduces STA-LBiGRU to capture intricate behavior patterns. The resulting context-aware framework enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of insider threat prediction, offering organizations improved capabilities for detecting and addressing dangers from insiders.
